# Aircraft Engine Design Project

This repository contains the design and analysis of a gas-turbine turbofan engine for a modern civilian aircraft using PCA-EPA software such as PARA-PERF by Prof. Jack D. Mattingly. 

## Overview

The project involves designing an optimal turbofan engine capable of meeting the performance requirements of the specified aircraft, considering efficiency, thrust, and fuel economy. The key objectives include:

1. **Mission Analysis**: Calculating thrust and fuel consumption for various flight segments.
2. **Parametric Cycle Analysis**: Conducting cycle analysis to determine optimum engine parameters (e.g., bypass ratio, compressor pressure ratio).
3. **Engine Performance Analysis**: Sizing the engine for takeoff and evaluating its performance throughout the mission.

### Aircraft Specifications:
- **Maximum Gross Takeoff Weight**: 1,645,760 N  
- **Cruise Speed**: Mach 0.83  
- **Payload**: 253 passengers + cargo (420,780 N)  
- **Range**: 11,120 km  

### Tools Used:
- PCA-EPA Software: PARA-PERF for parametric and performance analysis.
